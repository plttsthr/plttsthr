-  Fun Fact: I’m a senior Computer Science student at Texas Tech University, and I have a love for languages. 
My first language is Spanish, and I've since learned English and a little bit of Korean, with plans to learn French in the future. 
When I'm not coding or learning languages, you can find me swimming, doing HIIT, Pilates, or taking long walks with my dog Loui 🐶.
